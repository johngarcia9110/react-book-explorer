## Description:

This project allows the user to search for books within the Google books database. This is a personal project that stemmed from my click fatigue when looking for new books to read on google books. I have reduced the number of clicks and page reloads the user experiences when searching for books by using React.js and the Google books api together.


## Tools:

React | Node | Express| Webpack | Google Books Api
